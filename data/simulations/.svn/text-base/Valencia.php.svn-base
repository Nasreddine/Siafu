$description="<p>This simulation was written for a demo, and as such, it is a bit specific. It is similar to the Glasgow scenario, but the map is set in Valencia, at around the time of the America's cup. There's two users, Pietro and Teresa, who go through a series of steps involving meeting at the cinema and going for dinner. During the demo, we had devices connected to their context, and so each step pauses the simulation to allow showing the terminals to the public. Check the SimulationSteps enum in Constants for details on the demo script.</p>";
